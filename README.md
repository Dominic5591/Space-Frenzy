# ClickFrenzy - JavaScript Project

[Visit my GitHub!](https://github.com/Dominic5591)

## Background

ClickFrenzy is a JavaScript game where players aim to click and pop bouncing balls that float around the game canvas. The balls will bounce off walls and each other, creating a dynamic environment. The objective is to strategically click on the balls to make them expand and 'pop', triggering chain reactions that can hit other balls. The game incorporates a timer, a scoring system, and a challenge aspect where players receive X's for each missed click. If a player has three X's, they lose the game. Players can submit their initials along with their points, and the game uses local storage to store this information.

## Functionality & MVPs

Players in ClickFrenzy can:

- Click on balls to make them expand and pop.
- Ball physics, bouncing off walls and interactions with other balls.
- Earn points for clicking and poping balls and bonuses for chain reactions.
- Face a challenge system with three X's indicating a loss if three clicks are missed.
- Submit initials and points for a local high score.

In addition, this project will include:

- Instructions for the users.
- Feedback for successful pops and missed clicks.
- A option to mute sound/music.
