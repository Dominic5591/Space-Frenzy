## Features

- Responsive controls
- High-score tracking

## Technical Details
SpaceFrenzy is coded completely in vanilla Javascript. The game is drawn onto a canvas element and updated using the browser's requestAnimationFrame function and using localStorage to store users highscore. Additional functionality is added to buttons and other elements outside of the canvas by manipulating DOM objects with javascript.


## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

- HTML, CSS for structure and styling.
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic.
- Local storage for high scores and game progress.
- Webpack to bundle JS files


## The high score system is stored using localStorage
